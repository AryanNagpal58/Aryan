# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
'''
The difference between the three is that Git is a version control system which tracks
changes in coding over time, GitHub is a website that hosts the priorly mentioned
Git repositories online and allows them to be shared and edited by multiple people, and
GitBash is the online interface which can be used to edit coding with Git.
'''

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
'''
The difference between the terminal and the command line is that terminal acts as the
platform for which the command line is used for typing in commands to give to a computer.
'''

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
'''
Windows PowerShell is different from GitBash because they are under different domains of creation.
Windows PowerShell is the original PowerShell for Windows computers, and is made specifically for
Windows computers, while Git Bash is a package that is used for coding Git on a Windows computer, and 
emulates the original Windows PowerShell interface, but using Linux for coding with Git.
'''
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
'''
The difference between the three is that Anaconda is a large distribution of packages that come together to create
a coding enviornment. Conda is a part of that Anaconda enviornment, and is a system for creating, saving, and working on packages.
Python is then the language included in Anaconda and, through that, conda, and is a general coding language used a lot in data science.
'''
# 5) What is VS Code? 
'''
VS Code is a platform for coding in multiple languages, such as Python, C++, and JavaScript. It is a way to create and edit folders
and files for coding, organize them, and run them for debugging and application.
'''
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
'''
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based app for editing, sharing, and combining live code. It is different from Jupyter Lab
'''
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
'''
~/ is the symbol used for a home directory in the pathway of objects.
'''
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
'''
The difference between an absolute path and a relative path in coding is that an absolute path displays all
folders, files, and other objects used to make-up the directory of an object, while the relative path will only show those
that are relative to the current directory that a user is within. When an absolute path is called for a certain object, the full
directory pathway will be shown. When a relative pathway is called for the same object, only those that come after the current
directory being worked in will be shown.
'''
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
'''
Absolute path:
/c/Users/Aryan Nagpal/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
Relative path:
../../../python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
'''
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
'''
To move from "course_assignments/homework2/ to just "course_assignments/", you would need to
use the command 'cd ..'.
'''
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
'''
The command 'rm .' while in my current directory will remove the current file or directory that I am inside of
within a further pathway.
'''
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
# git commit
# git push
'''
The 'git add' command adds any changes being made to any files from being unstaged to being in the
staging area, which is the area that is used for double-checking said changes before having them saved.
The 'git commit' command records changes to a local repository, and may include a message from the user making
the changes.
The 'git push' command fully saves the changes made to any file, and has them updated in the local repository.
'''
# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
'''
The difference between the two is that the command 'git add .' will start the saving process for all files that have
been worked on, while the command 'git add <file>' will start the saving process for only the files that are included
in the command.
'''
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
'''
The command "git status" checks the current status of any changes being made to files that would
be within a git repository, allowing users to check what has been saved or not so far in their work.
The command "git log -1" displays the history of changes that have been made to a git repository.
'''
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
'''
The difference between the two is that cloning a repository is the act of creating an identical
copy of the initial repository in a different location, while pulling from it is updating any changes
made from the initial remote repository and applies them to the local repository on the user's computer.
'''
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
'''
My most frustrating error within the class so far has been with VS Code, because at the start of the class,
I kept having an error pop up every time that I tried to run my code. I believe it was something along the lines
of conda not being supported. The error went away on its own, however, after I made some small changes to my file's code,
even though the I did not see any large connection between what I was coding and the error that came up. I have also struggled 
a little with keeping track of where different files are kept within my Users folder.
'''
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
'''
What is the difference between a repository and a directory? Also, I am still a little confused about
how multiple people can work on maybe the same non-remote repository.
'''
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
'''
Australia is wider than the Moon.
'''
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)

print(5 ** 5)
#This math expression will print 5 to the exponential power of 5, or 3125
